Dear All,
 
We have now put together the infrastructure for parsing our examples using GF, and made a parser that several constructions.
These cover examples 2 and 20. You get the following parse trees:
 

PNLS> IsA (QNP Every Violinist) Musician
PNLS> S2 (QNP GenericPl Musician) Generally ReadMusic
PNLS> If (IsA John Violinist) (S1 John ReadMusic)

PNLS> S2 John Always (ComparVP Equal Punctual Mary)
PNLS> S2 Sam Usually (ComparVP More Punctual John)
PNLS> S1 Sam (ComparVP More Punctual Mary)

To run the parser:

cd parser
./parsesuite.sh 

To add new constructions to the parser, you need to change PNLS.gf and PNLSEng.gf. The first file contains the abstract grammar. The second one describes the mapping to English. So every new construction/lexicon entry needs to be added in both files. 

It was not clear to us if some syntactic constructions were crucial for the intended purpose, so we stopped here. (An alternative to adding some construction is to simplify examples.)

Please let us know if anything is unclear!

Best,
-- JP and Aleksandre.
